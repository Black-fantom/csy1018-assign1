          <p>Badal is Computer gaming geek. He really loves to play computer game more than playing game he love to hack that game. He really loves adventurous game when he was a child he used to play a GTA vice city game more than he sleep.
            He has really bad habit he get easily bored by same thing so he has never fully completed any game. That’s one reason that he has no any girlfriend. <br><br>
            He  loves programming if his code doesn't works he gets really mad and freaked out but he will manage  to find out the solution. He also loves to break things on pieces and some how he manages to fixed it. <br><br>
            He has many nick names his friends call him by different name but he don’t like being call with different name expect Mr.Cloud .He gets really  happy when some call him Mr Cloud .
            Rather than gaming he also has adventurous spirit he loves to travel different places but he has a problem he can not  travel for long time in bus. He start vomiting if he travel long time in bus.
            He has a motion sickness so he stay away from amusement park. <br>
            He is one of laziest person in this world. He is expert in creating excuse from doing work. He is great fan of Japanese a
            nime series he can spend whole night and day just by watching anime. Creating a negative  double meaning of any word is in his DNA. He crack jokes in serious moment. <br><br>
            Social status of Badal is to poor, being socialize is not his type. He really love to live alone. In spite of his social status he has three closet idiot friend.  <br><br>

            After all this one question rises who the hell is he?
            He is neither Superman who enroll suits before he lift nor iron man who wear iron suits. He is simple normal person son of father and mother. He is neither a business man nor owner of any company.
            He is just a normal student of NAMI college who love to programming and want to achieve success at the speed of Superman.
